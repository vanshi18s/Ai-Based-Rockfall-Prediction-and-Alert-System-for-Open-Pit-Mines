A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.



 
 -> open source packages:-

    Charts & Data Visualization

    fl_chart
        → Line charts, bar charts, pie charts (sensor trends, forecasts).

    syncfusion_flutter_charts
        (free for community use, but needs attribution) → Gauge charts, heatmaps, advanced plots.

    syncfusion_flutter_datagrid
        → Tables for historical events & logs.

 -> Maps & Geo-Visualization

    flutter_map
    → OpenStreetMap-based, fully open source.

    latlong2
    → Needed for coordinates in flutter_map.

    geojson
    → Parse mine slope zones (DEM overlays).

    (Alternative: google_maps_flutter
    , but not fully open source → requires Google API key. Judges usually like flutter_map + OSM because it’s open.)
